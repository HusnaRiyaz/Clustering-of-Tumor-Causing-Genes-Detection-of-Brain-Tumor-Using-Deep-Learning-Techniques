# Brain Tumor :
  Brain tumor is a lethal disease affecting millions of people around the globe and the mortality rate increases by each year. 
  
  Early identification and segmentation of brain tumor helps to increase the survival chances of the patients.

# Procedure:
  In this study firstly, the genes(TCGA-Gene Expression dataset) responsible for different types of tumors are clustered together using K-means clustering algorithm. 
  
  Then identification of a specific tumor say Brain tumor using MRI images (Br35H - 3060 MRI images) was performed  using Deep Learning techniques : CNN and Ensemble Model- with Pre-trained networks(MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, Xception).

# Conclusion:
  CNN yielded an accuracy of 0.986.
